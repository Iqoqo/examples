## Pull Request Process

1. Create a branch to base the PR.<br>
`$ git checkout -b dennisobrien/docs-contrib`<br>
TODO: How does the DISCO team prefer to name branches.
1. In that branch, create a directory for your example. For any example that
requires some background, please provide a README.md file within the directory.
1. Commit and push your changes to your branch.  Then create the Pull Request.
1. Get a "looks good to me" from at least two other developers.  Then merge your PR.
1. When the PR is accepted and merged, delete the branch.
